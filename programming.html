            <h2>Subtle Interest</h2>
            <p>I initially started my undergraduate career studying Biology, pursuing a career as a pediatrician.
            However, instead of spending time studying in my science classes, I spent time watching programming/coding videos on YouTube in my free time.
            This is when I realized that I was not passionate about medicine whatsoever and needed a career change.
            What better career choice was there besides the one I had already put a lot of time into and was more passionate about?

            <h2>My First Programming Course</h2>
            <p>My first programming course was CS303 at UT Austin.
                It was a basic Python course that taught me the fundamentals and the basic syntax.
                However, on the side I did my own DSA and LeetCode courses to try and develop better problem-solving skills.
                Overall, a very easy course and I had a lot of fun completing the projects and seeing quick results in regards to my programming skill.

            <h2>My First Project</h2>
            <p>My first project was PokerLedgerSettler.py!
                It was a Python algorithm that was built to help my friend, Rodney, track the financial transactions of his hosted poker games.
                It asks the gamerunner for inputs of the player buy-ins, cash-outs, and determined who would owe money to each player according to their PNL.
                It was a basic and simple algorithm, but as a newer programmer, I took a lot of pride in being able to apply my real-life challenges to my projects.
                Essentially, it was the first challenge I wanted to address through code, and I successfully solved it with this application!

            <h2>My First Website
                <a href="https://utpokerclub-0ed6dd12a0bb.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">(Link)</a>
            </h2>
            <p>My first website was the club website I created for the UT Poker Club!
                It was built using Django and Python for the back-end framework and HTML and CSS for the front-end. It also incorporated an SQLite database to track certain information about club members and activities.
                The website has pages displaying trusted club members, club activity, and the steps to take if users were interested in joining the poker club.
                It was my first pivotal breakthrough into web development, and I was able to learn a lot about the web development process, as well as web analytics and production.
